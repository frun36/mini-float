# mini-float
This is a simple, lightweight, `no_std` Rust library which enables the use of smaller floating point types.

I decided to create it when I realized a small floating-point type would be ideal for my Raspberry Pi Pico W weather station's LED "display". Currently it only implements the `f8` type, with **very limited functionality** - I might add more features if needed.
